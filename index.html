<h1><u>Code inventory</u></h1>
<h2>by Thomas Lloyd</h2>
<p>Hello, this is a website I'm using to keep track of all my code that I am or have worked on. At this point it is mostly just some basic Python scripts that I have written some of it for my high school computer class, but most of it was made because I had an idea and wanted to bring it to life, this website being one of them.</p>
<br>
<p>my other goal for this website is to use it as a phedo portfolio for collge and for jobs at some point</p>
